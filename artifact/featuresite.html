				<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>hotography is a passion of mine, and my work as a photographer has allowed me the pleasure of collaborating with some fascinating individuals that do nude modeling and practice it as a form of art. Despite how hard they work and how much they love their craft, they’re consistently met with scorn, judgement, and ridicule.<blockquote class="pullquoteblack">Balancing striking and provocative imagery with lengthy feature text left me with the delicate task of walking on razor’s edge.</blockquote> I made this feature website to help humanize these women and rebrand their craft in a professional context that the public can more easily relate to and better understand. With the subject being so close to my heart, this was one of the most challenging design problems that I’ve faced.

				Balancing striking and provocative imagery with lengthy feature text left me with the delicate task of walking on razor’s edge. Too much text would mean the viewers wouldn’t read the articles or come to accept its message. At the same time, too much striking imagery could offend the viewer and leave them with the wrong impression. It was for these reasons that worked cautiously on the design of each article, and carefully chose the imagery specifically tailored to it’s respective paragraph and page. In addition, I wanted the the document to appear sophisticated and have an air of authority. I achieved this by formatting the feature site to resemble a print newspaper. Ample amounts of whitespace were included as well as carefully chosen pull-quotes and drop-caps.  I went with baskerville as my chosen typeface to help further convey an air of maturity and sophistication.
